I conducted some more research on player movement, collision detection and game event handling in pygame, eventually culminating in a proof of concept program in the form of a snake game.
The snake game showcases basic playable character movement, collision detection with an enemy sprite and game event handling (e.g what happens in a game over scenario). Also, a basic array based random generation function has been implemented to showcase a base proof of concept for my eventual plan of procedurally generating the map in the form of tileset maps.
Sprite animation is not a concern right now as I am working on the functionalities of the game first.
