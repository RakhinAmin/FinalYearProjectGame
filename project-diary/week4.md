3rd November:

- I experienced an issue with VS Code while working on another project which meant I had to reinstall VS Code.
- Faced a severe issue with cloning my project git repository onto my machine
- Had to contact CIM helpdesk who could not immediately sort out the issue
- Further researched movement and collision systems in pygame in the meantime
