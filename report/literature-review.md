LITERATURE REVIEW:
The importance of Object Oriented Programming cannot be stressed whenever an individual is writing a piece of code or program and especially when undertaking a large project such as a highly complex video game. Without Object Oriented Programming, my game code would be hard to understand, hard to debug and be very difficult to implement new features onto, especially as I know I will be implementing new additions and sections to my game during the next term which will inevitably require reworking of old code and a good understanding of methods.
Object Oriented Programming resolves the shortcomings of traditional structured programming by introducing the idea of reusing objects to organise code in an efficient manner. With this approach, software can be created that offers far greater flexibility and extensibility compared to using a procedure based design (O1).
