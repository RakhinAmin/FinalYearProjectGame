LITERATURE REVIEW:
The importance of Object Oriented Programming cannot be stressed whenever an individual is writing a piece of code or program and especially when undertaking a large project such as a highly complex video game. Without Object Oriented Programming, my game code would be hard to understand, hard to debug and be very difficult to implement new features onto, especially as I know I will be implementing new additions and sections to my game during the next term which will inevitably require reworking of old code and a good understanding of methods.
Object Oriented Programming resolves the shortcomings of traditional structured programming by introducing the idea of reusing objects to organise code in an efficient manner. With this approach, software can be created that offers far greater flexibility and extensibility compared to using a procedure based design (O1). This is because it allows the opportunity to contain data objects in one class and use inheritance to call upon those attributes and class methods later on in the code whenever needed, which in my case would be creating a class purely for the player methods and attributes and then inheriting those later on to create a computer controlled character who inherits the same movement and boundaries as the player character. This idea of class inheritance creates tremendous opportunity for code reuse (O1).
Reading this paper on understanding object oriented programming helped me understand how I can clean up my coding process and write code for my game in a way that would allow me to further improve it or add on features without difficulty as the paper clearly explained the methods of object oriented programming using the example of a Ford Escort being a class of automobile, with “my1998GrayFordEscortThatNeedsNewTyres” (O1) being a specific object from that class blueprint, an ideology I applied to my game code using the player class as the main class which other enemy characters can then inherit from and share its attributes.
Using the book “Python 3 Object Oriented Programming” has been instrumental so far in my success of implementing object oriented programming practises into my game as it “focuses on object oriented design”. With the book I learned how to use class
Seeing as I am using pygame which is a relatively low level and simple game module using python that does not support 3d graphics, I had to research ways to implement intellectual thinking and creativity into my game and decided to incorporate noise procedural generation into my game to create a randomly generated terrain for the map design.
