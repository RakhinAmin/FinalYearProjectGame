ABSTRACT:
Video games have been increasingly shown to increase cognitive control in the brain. The definition of cognitive control is the set of neural processes which the human brain uses in order to allow the human body to interact with the environment and adapt to changing environments (A1). This function of the brain is controlled by the prefrontal cortex part of the brain (A2), and video games are food for this part of the brain having been proven to help improve the cognitive abilities of humans who play and interact with them. This coupled with the fact that a large majority of the population has access to technologies capable of rendering video games, with 64 percent of the worldwide population having access to the internet, cemented my decision to create an easily accessible game that will be hosted on a website.
Currently I have not implemented the web hosting part of the game as I am still working on the core functionalities of the video game. As I am aiming for this game to be used primarily by younger people in education who can use the game as a tool for alleviating stress (A7) while enhancing their cognitive skills, making the game accessible via the internet is the most efficient way to distribute copies, particularly since internet access is so fundamental to educational studies with the British Government promising to incorporate high speed internet access to every school in the country by 2025 (A4).
Students who are invested and interested in a game will happily spend hundreds if not thousands of hours into mastering a game using critical and strategical thinking (A5), such as the students of Western Kentucky University who used a historical strategy game Civilisation III to help with a research paper on historical Western civilisations (A6). This is why I came to the conclusion that I should not focus on educational aspects but purely on fun and critical thinking.
There have been successful examples of educational games. I researched intriguing games that have been built down the educational road such as a math archery game built by the STEM video game winners of 2012, a “game which teaches arithmetic” (A3), I decided upon further reflection to start developing an infinite scrolling shooting game on pygame as this would be more engaging for people who might otherwise become bored and disengaged with a more education focused game. Also, the main purpose of my project is to improve cognitive skills and focus, so a scrolling 2d platformer achieves these goals. Furthermore, the limited timeframe that has been delegated of 20 to 25 weeks for this project is not enough to enlarge the scope of the game to reach both the casual and educational crowd.
My original project plan only briefly touched upon the specifics of what my game will contain and how it will function. My plan was to create a game that does not delve into teaching specific educational aspects but instead is based on strategical thinking and training the motor functions of the human brain to be able to react quickly and improve hand eye coordination, which I have manifested in the form of a 2d scrolling shooter in which the player has to traverse an infinite scrolling map. This infinite map scrolls whichever way the player moves, so the camera is attached to the player and follows the player movements. The difficulty in the game is formed through computer controlled enemies, who spawn throughout the map and try to kill the player. The player has a weapon and is given a survival scenario where they have to travel as large of a distance as possible while killing the computer controlled enemies. Eventually, a high score function will be implemented to introduce a competitive element to the game and show the player how much progress they have achieved. After considering different game engines such as unity and unreal engine, I decided to use pygame which is a game module for python as it is easy to utilise various aspects of game coding such as game collisions and player input. Python makes it very easy to create readable and simplistic code which is easy to understand, especially with using object oriented programming which future proofs large projects such as this game because it allows functions to be made as classes and reusable for any further ideas that you want to implement.
Animation has not been a priority since I am more concerned about the actual playability and mechanics of the game. So far I have created a few proof of concept programs, with the aim of implementing all of them together in a final product. I have managed to build once that demonstrates basic player animation, in which the player character image will flip and change direction depending on which directional button is pressed. I also have a proof of concept of increasing difficulty and score keeping in the form of a snake game: the difficulty increases in the form of the snake increasing length after eating a fruit, and a console counter score is kept. The main functionality that I wanted to show off this term is the Terraria like procedural map generation as it shows intellectual thinking in an otherwise simplistic game engine, adding a layer of complexity to the final game. Also procedural generation is more helpful in the long term as it means that individual levels do not have to be handcrafted but can instead be one infinite level that computationally creates unique level structure for the player.
